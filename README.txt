This oxygen saturation monitoring application serves as a component of the larger Peak Rescue system - a guardian angel focused on detecting acute mountain sickness and user wellbeing during outdoor excursions. As part of the health assessment capabilities, this module simulates interfacing with a Bluetooth pulse oximeter to acquire blood oxygen measurements. Since physical devices are currently unavailable, it mocks the connectivity, readings and integrations programmatically as a proof of concept. The readings could be used to evaluate early signs of altitude sickness, triggering alerts to the user and emergency services if dangerous drops in levels are observed.
