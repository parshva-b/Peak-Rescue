# Fuzzy Logic Component

This component is designed to assess the risk of acute mountain sickness (AMS) using a fuzzy logic system. The system uses a questionnaire to collect information about the user's symptoms, altitude information, and weather forecast to determine the risk of AMS.

## Getting Started

To use this component, you will need to download the .fis file and run it on MATLAB. The .fis file contains the membership functions, fuzzy rules, and inference system needed to assess the risk of AMS.

Please note that this component is part of a larger app that includes additional features such as altitude information and weather forecast. To see the whole app working, you will need to download the app from the main branch. This current branch only represents the work done for project 4 individual contributions to the whole project.

## Usage

To use the fuzzy logic component, you will need to provide the user's responses to the questionnaire, altitude information, and weather forecast. The system will then use this information to assess the risk of AMS and provide personalized recommendations to the user.
